This package contains the implementation of the Audible Integrator project,
which demonstrates the differences between numerical integration methods
for classical mechanics simulations through audio sonification.

Modules:
    - integrators: Four numerical integration methods (Euler, RK4, Verlet, Leapfrog)
    - physics: Harmonic oscillator and double pendulum systems
    - sonification: Real-time audio synthesis based on system energy
    - visualization: Plotting utilities for phase space and energy
